<h2>Group Reflection on working as a team</h2>
<p><b>Trill</b><br>This was my first time working with a group, so to some level, group work was always going to be surprising. What worked well was everyone contributing to the Microsoft Team sections whenever their opinions were needed for an aspect as part of the project. That everyone mostly turned up every meeting was very good, and that we were all contributing some materials was important. At least one new thing that I have learned about working in groups is that for meetings to be an effective and efficient everyone in the group must be on the same page. I also learned to perhaps make more time for reviewing than previously thought. Another lesson was that things that ordinarily would not take one person on their own as long – such as deciding the design layout or working out what design logo to have – can take longer in a group where more than one opinion or difference of ideas can occur; hence why it is important to leave more time than you think for the finalisation of a result. Our group’s ability to make decisions quickly is an area for improvement that I see - effectively assigning roles quickly and efficiently may be a place where our group can learn from.</p>
<p><b>Charles</b><br>Simply Code has managed to come together as a team despite personal obligations outside of study and time constraints. We have managed to set meeting times and have an attendance of 100% most of the time. Working well within the team with no resentment towards others and a courtesy to the highest degree. However, the speed at which decisions have been made has been a slight hold-back for the group, causing meetings to run longer due to the politeness and introverted nature of the group. The ability to act quickly and decisively may come across as rude yet is a necessity when working within a group to achieve a desired outcome within a time restraint.</p>
<p>Yet from the forming of the group till now a few surprises have been witnessed from all members including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trillion’s ability to take charge within the group and chair meetings, even though she is much younger than many in the team.</li>
  <li>Kiran’s ability and determination to be a functioning part of an online team, even while traveling and with a lack of internet access.</li>
  <li>Marius’s creativeness and ability to bring tools and ideas to the team.</li>
  <li>Tiarna’s ability able to attend online meetings and not have the house burn down in the background due to the kids. Considering I struggle with only one, that cannot even walk yet.</li>
  <li>Sean’s knowledge and experience in the field of university and IT, helping the group’s quality of work improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>From working within Simply Code as an online group, I have learned that organisation and constant communication is key to having an effective and functional team. As the ability to communicate ideas in an effective way that is easily understandable by all can not only help increase productivity, but also allow for healthier relationships between group members.</p>
<p><b>Kiran</b><br>Simply Code is a dynamic team through which the collaborative workplace of Information Technology can be glimpsed. Shortly after coming together, the group came to consensus on convenient meeting times, with each member sharing their backgrounds, before assignment 1 was due for submission. This gave the group a solid start, leading to success in completing Assignment 2.</p>
<p>One slight speedbump that the group encountered was in our group meetings. The group had a high attendance rate, given various members of the group workings different shifts and having other life events. The meetings, however, tended to go on longer than advised in the course material. The discussion was always valuable, guiding the progress of our assignment, though it was not always fully focused on the set agenda. This was not a significant issue since each meeting’s chairperson learned to guide the meeting better as the project progressed. This continued guidance, alongside a need for the group members to discipline their mic-mute while not being the primary speaker would allow the group to improve their meetings.</p>
<p>One learning point in the IT professional’s journey that has come through collaboration with this group is the breadth and variety of people and their experiences. Whether it be a client with small programming job, the experienced IT professional completing the same RMIT course, or the enthusiasm of a fellow explorer on the path of IT, collaborating while surrounded with this wealth of experience makes for a pleasant journey.</p>
<p><b>Marius</b><br>The way work was split up and allocated to each member as soon as we kicked off the project was very effective, and we started the larger tasks early on. Furthermore, the review process worked very well in ensuring that the sections completed by different team members were cohesive and read as one document.</p>
<p>The collaborative work on some sections could be improved to gather more opinions from the team instead of leaving the allocated team member to work independently. Unfortunately, as the team worked with very different schedules and commitments and a short time frame, it was not as convenient to organise these brainstorming sessions where everyone could participate on one topic.</p>
<p>Even though the team did not have a clearly defined team leader, some team members stepped up to assume that role when required to ensure decisions were still being made. In addition, most team members would voice their concerns and reflections when any decision was being made, ensuring we were making the right choice, albeit at our own pace.</p>
<p>The key to progressing through the tasks when collaborating with team members having different opinions is the ability to compromise. In some cases, the choices presented each carried their value and did not discredit the others. There were no right or wrong options but just the idea that all team members would have to agree on one as the team’s advancement was being impeded.</p>
<p><b>Tiarna</b><br>While there were some challenges working in a group setting, there were also many positive aspects. We met up for our first online team video meeting, and after some introductions, we agreed to work together as a team instead of electing a team leader. We developed polls in our wiki using Microsoft Teams to vote when certain tasks were required to be completed for our assignment, making decisions and allocated tasks as a team. Overall, this worked out well for our team; we were all able to contribute our ideas and comments, and we were all able to vote on the best potential outcome for our assignment content.</p>
<p>By establishing a clear, precise agenda and sticking to it, weekly recorded meetings involving all group members might be improved. Some meetings were not attended by all team members, and later viewing of the video revealed some confusion, with the discussion veering off course with debates and unnecessary information, resulting in our meeting stretching long past the recommended time. Any issues, queries, or concerns should be addressed at the end of the recording section or in the group written chat, and any issues that require a group vote should be submitted to the wiki.</p>
<p>I chose Introduction to Information and Technology to obtain a basic understanding of IT because I am a novice and was astonished by how educated my peers are in the field. I am fortunate to be part of a team that is patient with me and willing to help me with things I do not fully comprehend.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Marius impressed me with his knowledge, creativity, and ability to maintain control while shouldering a large portion of the team project's responsibility.</li>
  <li>Despite his demanding work schedule and the fact that he has a small family to care for, Charles continued to put his hand up to volunteer for and complete tasks.</li>
  <li>Despite travelling around Australia and not always having access to the internet, Kieran was able to successfully contribute to team meetings, conversations, and tasks towards the completion of our assignment.</li>
  <li>Sean's knowledge in certain aspects of IT surprised me. It was a great help to all of us when we needed advice, as well as assistance with producing the content for our assignment 2 and having our work reviewed. Sean had already taken classes and knew what to expect while working in a group dynamic, thus he was able to successfully set up the way we operated as a team.</li>
  <li>Despite being the youngest, Trill's IT skills, persistent willingness to volunteer for duties, and ability to chair online team meetings have all pleasantly surprised me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in a group environment has taught me that while we are all taking this course to learn from our instructors, we are also learning from one another. My teammates have taught me a lot, both intentionally and unintentionally, not only about IT, such as reviewing, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, essay writing, creating webpages, GitHub, Microsoft Teams, and so on, but also about life in general, and I am excited to work with them on future projects.</p>
<p><b>Sean</b><br>Having experienced many opportunities to work in a team or group for both study and career, each instance has presented unique challenges and opportunities to learn something new. In forming Simply Code, the team established a very democratic approach to the team management, yet as often happens in such cases, a couple of team members have emerged with leadership qualities, even while the team continued to function as a collective. Since the team has created a report together, this committee approach has worked well for this project because the team members were communicative, supported each other, and made excellent use of all the collaboration tools at the team’s disposal. A defined leader may have been more of a hindrance in the early stages as the team were learning to communicate, gauge the abilities of their peers, and learning to trust in each other.</p>
<p>For the next assessment, however, the team will need to apply a different approach. While everyone accepted responsibilities and worked on them diligently, some tasks were pushed back because they remained undecided, undefined, and the team seemed hesitant to take responsibility for them early, costing the team valuable time to dedicate to the project idea section. Others in the team took on a lot more work than they could reasonably complete on time, leading to bottlenecks. Therefore, the lack of clear leadership was also a detriment as it impeded early project organisation and planning. The team also needs to improve the meeting process, since the meeting chair position was unfortunately seen at times as a platform to impose policy rather than facilitate discussion, resulting in some meetings that did not follow a group-led agenda or stimulate group discussion. As a result, a lesson learned about group work in this instance, is that it would be prudent for a team ‘constitution’ to be created and agreed early in the project to identify responsibilities and establish team rules moving forward. This is particularly important considering the next assignment which will require a greater degree of organisation to be completed well, and on time.</p>
<p>I have been pleasantly surprised by each team member in our short time together. Trillion is clearly passionate about the subject matter and is still learning yet is forthright and holds her own in the company of the team. Charles has a fantastic sense of humour and has left the odd comment or two as we have worked, lifting the mood when we have felt pressured by the workload. Tiarna is the only person in the group studying the subject out of interest rather than needing to for a degree and is likely to be a real asset to the Navy when she follows her dream. Kiran can cram a wealth of information into concise sentences, which has been an asset given his struggle to remain online while still attending the team meetings during his travels. Marius is always the first to give credit to others, even when they have helped him with something that seemed trivial to them. This has been a wonderful group of people to work with, and I am looking forward to the next stage of our studies together.</p>
