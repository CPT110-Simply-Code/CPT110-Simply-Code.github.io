Tiarna likes reading, movies, tv shows, having family days, bbq’s, arts and crafts, playing bingo and doing escape rooms. 
At a young age she enjoyed playing games on her computer and her passion grew as she got older. 
Tiarna and her husband own a real estate marketing company, which involves a lot of computer work, 
mainly using Adobe Photoshop, Bridge, Illustrator and various websites to complete their workload. 
Tiarna decided to study the course “Introduction to Information and Technology” at RMIT,  
to extend her knowledge of computer systems and troubleshooting, so she can progress and grow her business. 
She is also hoping to learn about system diagnosis and recovery, communication through a variety of systems (e.g. Teletype, morse code), 
and encoding and decoding for a possible career in the Navy as a Communication and Information Systems Operator in the future.
On completion of this course Tiarna is hoping to continue on to get her degree in information Technology. 
She has formed a team known as Simply code with 5 of her fellow classmates to complete their group assignments.
