    <p>After reviewing several videos on YouTube which presented several viewpoints regarding IT industry roles,
      the team decided to describe the following 5 professions based on the ideal jobs chosen by the team
      members. The selection allowed the team to reflect on their ideal job's choice, assisting each team
      member to solidify their opinions in contrast to some of the many other IT career choices available. The
      following videos and roles were reviewed for consideration:

    <p><b>Cybersecurity Analyst</b><br>

    <p>
      Cybersecurity analysts study and respond to anomalies discovered and generated
       by computer usage and internet browsing around the world. One of the challenges 
       they face is the vast volume of logs and events that arrive each day to be 
       analysed. This might be anything from 5000 to 15,000 log entries per second, 
       or over 150,000 for a much larger organisation, and this is work that takes 
       up most of the analyst's time. Most occurrences are sorted by software, which 
       either flags them as safe or stamps them as alerts if they pose a concern. 
       The alerts are then forwarded to the cybersecurity analyst, who will review 
       and triage them to decide whether someone is a threat or has committed a crime. 
       Cybersecurity analysts communicate with top-level colleagues, fellow analysts, 
       and system users daily to complete their tasks. They spend their days at 
       workstations working on computers in a security operation centre (SOC) 
       surrounded by monitors that alert them to potential threats.

      <p><b>Data Scientist</b><br>
        <a class= "work-link" href="https://youtu.be/xC-c7E5PK0Y">https://youtu.be/xC-c7E5PK0Y</a></p>
      <p>
        A data scientist is someone who collects, analyses, and cleans data. 
        They use machine learning to make decisions and compare data from multiple 
        sources to identify patterns and trends. They plan projects, solve problems, 
        strategize, research, recommend, generate graphics, and model implementations to 
        identify the optimal course for a company's growth and success. Depending on the 
        size of the company they have been hired to work for, they could be the project's 
        single data scientist responsible for all aspects of the project, or they could be 
        working with a team of software engineers, data engineers, research scientists, and 
        fellow data scientists, delegating tasks and focusing their time on what they do 
        best, as well as working closely with the client. Outlining realistic challenges 
        and devising acceptable methodologies for evaluating solutions is one of the most 
        difficult components of being a data scientist. Data scientists can work from 
        home or in the office because most of their work involves analysis.

       <p><b>Programmer</b><br>
          <a class= "work-link" href="https://youtu.be/E7TFbPRyi-c">https://youtu.be/E7TFbPRyi-c</a></p>
       <p>
        Computer programming is a position that necessitates a continually evolving 
        skill set to keep up with the ever-changing world of technology. A client 
        will employ a computer programmer to write code in several languages, such as 
        Python, C++, and Java, and expects their computer software to function in a smooth 
        and reliable manner. By assessing the client’s wants and needs a programmer will 
        convert program designs created by a production team of designers and engineers 
        into computer-readable instructions, the programmer will then create, develop, and 
        test the product whether it be a website, game, or phone app. This can now be done 
        anywhere, including from home, on-site, or within an IT department. They will keep 
        updating their projects to stay current with technology, and they will endeavour to 
        address and debug any issues that surface once the software is published and in use.
        </p>
       <p>
        A programmer may also be employed to test existing websites and applications to 
        ensure that they are working smoothly and efficiently. Meeting the demands of a 
        clientele is one of the most difficult tasks a programmer will encounter. If a 
        customer is unsure of what they want as a finished product or is constantly 
        changing specifications in the middle of a project, the programmer will have to 
        overcome these obstacles to accomplish the assignment within the deadlines allocated 
        to them.

        Communicating with clients experiencing technical issues with their telecommunication 
        devices and networks is the primary task of an IT Service Desk Analyst. They are 
        within the support team consulted to assess a problem, and either provide a solution
         or escalate to a technical specialist. Service desk analysts use a variety of 
         technologies and programmes to deliver timely and thorough technical and continuing 
         assistance. Analysts spend the majority of their time in a call centre or at an 
         office service desk, yet they are also expected to attend customer and management 
         meetings and collaborate with their co-workers. They are continually educated to 
         keep their knowledge up to date within the ever-changing world of technology and 
         customer service. The enormous volume of calls and emails that analysts must deal 
         with daily is one of the main challenges they may face, along with challenging 
         customers.

      <p><b>Technical Writer</b><br>
          <a class= "work-link" href="https://youtu.be/qnnkAWP55Ww">https://youtu.be/qnnkAWP55Ww</a><br>

        A Technical writer is hired to document how a product works in a straightforward, 
        precise, and clear manner to their client's target audience. The most challenging 
        and main responsibility is to conduct extensive research to become as knowledgeable 
        as possible on a specific product, its target audience, and its requirements, 
        ensuring that the information is accurate, up to date, and relevant. Technical 
        writers participate to brainstorm, write drafts, revise and edit project 
        documentation, while taking care to only include information that is essential 
        to the reader. They ensure their writing is consistent throughout each document, 
        using familiar terms and styles to avoid confusing the reader. Jargon is only 
        used, when necessary, where it is applicable to the target audience. Being writers, 
        they also check their grammar, punctuation, and spelling frequently and thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technical writer’s work should be clear, clean, and easy to navigate webpages
         or documents with large and basic font styles. Tabs, bullet points, clear and 
         easy-to-understand visual aids that make sense to the audience, proper spacing, 
         and a nice blank background should all be included to make the content easy to 
         read. Technical writers aren't just restricted to web pages or internal documentation, 
         they also write user documentation and manuals, sometimes by generating content that 
         will be saved as a PDF or a help file. Technical writers may also do all the writing 
         for whitepapers, and technical statements for press releases. APIs, software front 
         ends, help guides, UI manuals, developer information, deployment documentation, FAQs, 
         and anything else that requires the company voice treatment may also fall within the 
         technical writer’s responsibility,
