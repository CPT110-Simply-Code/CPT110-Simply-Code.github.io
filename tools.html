  <p>The choice of collaboration tools was made early on after the team came together. The Git repository was set up to follow the task instructions. However, compared to the other tools available, it was not the most suitable option for the type of collaborative work required, notably for the report writing part of the assignment. The team decided that the implementation of GitHub at this stage would primarily be for hosting the website pages. The way tasks were split up meant that only one team member would be handling the actual coding of the website while receiving input from the rest of the team on colour options, layout suggestions, and how to structure the website. Therefore, even though the whole team had input on designing the website and contributed their parts of the report, the GitHub activity log does not adequately reflect how the group worked on the different sections of the assignment.</p>
  <p>The ability to access the Microsoft suite of products enhanced the team’s collaborative efforts. With that access, the team decided to use SharePoint, an online team platform, as a repository for all the documentation to complete Assignment 2. A clear picture of the group’s activities and contributions can be presented by reviewing the logs of their SharePoint folder. The SharePoint platform also allowed high levels of teamwork via the online sharing and editing functionalities of Office 365, especially with the ability to have multiple users working on the same document in real-time. Most team members were already familiar with Microsoft Word, which meant a very shallow learning curve to go with this option. Furthermore, the platform has native mobile devices apps that meant that all the work being completed could be accessed from anywhere and anytime seamlessly. These services also connected with the desktop version of these apps, providing offline capabilities when required.</p>
  <p>While SharePoint was a valuable tool for managing project documentation, regular communication was conducted via Teams, another Microsoft product. The Teams chat function facilitated continuous conversation to share ideas, seek feedback on ongoing tasks, and discuss more minor details of the assignment between the more structured formal bi-weekly meetings. The built-in video conferencing was a critical feature for these regular meetings. In addition, the recording and automatic online hosting allowed team members that could not make it to the meetings to watch the proceedings quickly. The multiple plugins available in the app also added flexibility or additional features where required. For example, the wiki plugin was used to document all the meeting agendas, minutes, and action items, while the task planner plugin allowed creating a highly customisable task list helping manage outstanding tasks. As the application is also accessible from any web browser, meetings and discussion forums could conveniently be joined from any device without having to go through an installation process.</p>
  <p>The presence of Microsoft products continued with Excel, used to analyse the data in the Ideal Jobs and Industry Data sections. Excel first permitted the team to have a convenient way to sort and filter the different provided datasets from Burning Glass. The strong Excel chart capabilities then made it effortless to perform visual comparison of the several aspects of each team member’s ideal job.</p>
  <p>Another online collaboration tool utilised was Google Docs. It was found to be more flexible for working while travelling, allowing for offline backup and editing where no internet access is available. The features of Google Docs provided many of the same collaborative benefits as SharePoint’s integrated environment, allowing one team member to receive feedback and to make adjustments while travelling with limited internet availability.</p>
  <p>A selection of web browsers was used with Google Chrome predominant and reflecting current market share, with 66% usage in the group compared to 65% current global usage (StatCounter 2021). Other browsers used were Mozilla Firefox and Safari. While web browser choice followed personal preference, all browsers fully supported the team’s research work, connecting their respective users to study materials and the web-based tools used to complete the assignment.</p>
  <p>To build the layout and structure of the website Atom was used as code editor. Atom allows multiple html files to be open simultaneously, which was found to be highly efficient when developing a multi-page website, by switching between tabs to transfer the required code where needed. To diversify the experience and learn about other solutions Microsoft Visual Studio Code was later introduced to replace Atom when content had to be added to the website.</p>
  <p>All the tools were used on the four main operating systems (StatCounter 2021). Windows and MacOS for desktop computers and Android and iOS were used for mobile devices. Fortunately, with the increased focus of cross-platform app development, these tools were available across all operating systems used and offered a very similar experience to all team members regardless of choice of device or OS.</p>
