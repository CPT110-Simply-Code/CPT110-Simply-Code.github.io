  <p>Labour insight data was made available to the team in the form of a selection of charts from Burning Glass
    technologies. This information is used here to discuss the relevance of this data to the Simply Code team
    considering team member preferences for an ideal job. The data itself may be considered a little out of
    date given none of the data provided is newer than March 2018, however, it still serves as a useful tool
    with which to contrast team member expectations regarding their career preferences, and to determine
    if – given the data presented – any team member would be likely to change their minds as to whether
    they should pursue a different career specialty.</p>
  <h2>Job Titles & Occupations</h2>
  <p>From the ideal jobs that team members described in their Assignment 1 reports, several skills, job titles,
    and occupations were identified for comparison with the Burning Glass data. Three key occupations were
    identified in the team member’s ideal jobs advertisements: Software Developer, Cybersecurity
    Consultant, and Naval Communications and Information Systems (CIS) Operator. Per the Burning Glass
    (2018a) Top IT Jobs data, only the Software Developers had selected jobs with titles considered to be
    demand, or with the required skills needed to satisfy such job titles. Of the 25 job titles listed, 11 can be
    considered developer roles (as opposed to engineering) and reduces to 8 when identifying entry level
    roles suited to the team members at the completion of their higher education. Also of interest is the
    spread of job titles, which causes the data to appear somewhat misleading. While the most demanded
    job title was listed as Solutions Architect, the combined developer titles show that while certain job titles
    may be less in demand, the requirement for software developer roles is significantly greater than for most
    other job titles in the IT sector.
    </p>
  <p>This rudimentary analysis compares well to the Top Occupations data (Burning Glass 2018b), which, while
    it also separates several software development roles, shows a clear bias towards such occupations in
    terms of employer demand, specifically with the software developer/engineer occupation ranked highest
    in the data. The Cybersecurity Consultant choice also finds itself as an in-demand occupation at the 17th
    position in the rankings, and while there are comparably less matches in terms of the data, this may signify
    the role as more specialised that some of the other occupations listed. According to the Royal Australian
    Navy Warfare Sailors Career Handbook, a part of the CIS Officer’s role is the management of shipboard
    and onshore computer networks as well as other communication systems (RAN 2007), which implies a
    skillset that is – in part – comparable to that of a Network Engineer (ranked 19th in the data) and may
    therefore also be considered an in-demand occupation according to Burning Glass.</p>

  <h2>General Skills</h2>
  <p>The Hays Salary Guide for 2020/21 indicates (Hays 2021) that most ANZ employers across all sectors of
    the labour market currently view soft skills as equally important to the technical skills, with the top three
    skills being Teamwork, Problem Solving, and Communication. This appears to be a trend that has
    continued since the Burning Glass (2018c) data was extracted, where such “baseline” skills were listed
    within the top 5 ranked skills, communication being ranked 1st and problem solving a somewhat distant
    2nd. While the team’s ideal jobs listed several different general skills, between them they were likewise
    advertised with a combined emphasis on the same soft skills as the team’s top 3 most required general
    skills.
    </p>
  <p>The Burning Glass (2018c) data appears to show a significant difference between the top 2 most
    demanded soft skills at a ratio close to 3:1, however even though the team sample size is so small, the
    same difference between skills required for the team’s ideal jobs was not present, with the top 3 identified
    soft skills in parity. Leadership, Mentoring, and Team Building were the top 3 identified skills in the Burning
    Glass data which were not required for the team’s ideal jobs, and these soft skills ranked 11th, 13th, and
    18th respectively. This means that the team has sought roles with the top 10 general skills that were most
    in demand in IT in 2018.</p>
  
    <h2>IT Industry Skills</h2>
    <p>Narrowing down the team’s top 3 in demand IT specialised skills is a little less obvious, since a large
      proportion of common skills in the team’s jobs were split evenly between different team members, and
      because many of the team’s most common ideal job skills are not explicitly named in the Burning Glass
      (2018d) data. There are parallels though, and therefore the top identified IT skills that match the burning
      Glass data are: JavaScript, SQL, and Software Engineering, ranked at positions 2, 1, and 15 respectively.
      This result is entirely focused on the larger proportion of team members pursuing a software development
      pathway, in part because the software developer roles were advertised with an exhaustive list of
      technology skills required for those jobs, whereas the cybersecurity and CIS job advertisements required
      very few IT specific skills, and those listed were primarily network and infrastructure focused. This
      disparity reinforces the view that the non-programmer jobs are likely to be more specialised in terms of
      overall skillset.</p>
    <p>When reviewing the Burning Glass data for skills in demand that the team does not require, the options
      were much easier to identify. Knowledge of Microsoft Windows, Project Management, and SAP were
      ranked 4th, 5th, and 6th by Burning Glass (2018d), yet this still meant that some team members individually
      required skills in the top 3 in demand skills in the data. It could be expected that the data would once
      again skew heavily in the direction of the software developers given the large differences in demand for
      programmers vs non-programmers, however, the IT skills results were surprising given the promising
      outcomes noted in favour of the team in respect to the occupations and general skills data noted above.
      Perhaps employers may have searched for a very specific set of skills for their IT employees, however this
      would not explain why several skills – that were not limited specifically to IT roles – have appeared in the
      Burning Glass IT skills data. 
    </p>
    <p>Skills such as Building Relationships, Customer Service, and Business Process may require staff to have
      some IT related skills, yet they do not necessarily need to be IT focused. The Burning Glass (2018d) data
      also lists Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, skills usually associated with roles that are not typically
      IT occupations and would generally favour the business software that companies prefer for business
      administration and other non-IT specific work. This highlights a problem with the sampling method for
      the data, as there are many IT skills required by non-IT occupations, and these are likely to pollute any
      data intended to target IT industry occupations. On the surface this may seem that the data has no value
      to the team, however, this is far from the case. It is notable that non-IT specific occupations rely so heavily
      on the software and systems that are created and managed by those who choose an IT career. The
      Australian Government (2018) notes that technology skills are an educational priority to ensure that
      business can employ a workforce with IT skills that are transferrable, allowing businesses to transform
      how they operate as the digital economy continues to both support and drive such change. This implies a
      significant market demand for information technologies, which further implies a growing demand for the
      specialised skills required to create those same technologies.
    </p>
    <h2>Team Reflections</h2>
    <p>On reviewing the Burning Glass data, the team reflected individually about whether the industry data
      might change their opinions regarding their ideal jobs, and each contributed the paragraphs that follow.
      The overwhelming consensus, however, is that the team’s skills are transferrable, and each team member
      is keen to pursue a career that they are passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>Sean comments that the Burning Glass Data is considerably out of date, and the sampling method is
      questionable given the granular separation of job titles and occupations which does not appear to reflect
      a deeper understanding of the bigger picture requirements of IT industry. As an example, one might be
      drawn to conclude that there was a greater demand for solutions architects in 2018, however, the number
      of developer roles combined – not including software engineers – clearly outnumbered the solutions
      architects by a ratio of 9.5:1. Job demand is certainly important, particularly when first commencing a
      chosen career path, however a love for the job, and a genuine interested in the work, the company, and
      its culture is perhaps even more important. While the Burning Glass data itself is already inadequate to
      sway the decision to choose a developer role as an ideal job, research into the chosen company and with
      regards to the work required will if anything further cement my decision as being both appropriate, and
      well considered.</p>
    <p>
      For Marius, the Burning Glass data has reinforced his career choice as a Software Developer, rated as the
      number one in-demand occupation. Although it only comes up as the 19th job title, he found other job
      titles where the same IT skillset is required. The data has also helped him understand the most in-demand
      IT skills, which will help inform his decisions as he progresses through his Bachelor of IT.
    </p>
    <p>Kiran states that a review of the industry data did not result in a change of opinion. Choosing the best job
      is more than merely looking at what is in demand. There is a consensus in society that money cannot buy
      happiness. While it is important to choose a long-term viable career, many of the skills required for the
      chosen job are transferable, both the general and the IT skills. In the event of needing to reskill, this job 
      would place any IT professional in a good position to transition. From writing reports, to understanding IT
      systems, the Block Chain developer is solid waypoint in an IT career.</p>
    <p>Charles reflects that after looking at the data from Burning Glass his view regarding his ideal job has
      changed slightly. He is yet to make up his mind on what path he would like to follow, however from the
      data provided he has seen that even though the title may have changed the skills require have not. The
      goals Charles has set remain relevant; to learn and grow as much as possible throughout the journey that
      he has only recently set out on.</p>
    <p>Tiarna realised that the Burning Glass data was not entirely relevant to her desired navy position after
      reading it. Although there are many similarities with security and communications, she is not just focused
      on an IT career, but rather one in the military, where the goals and job opportunities are significantly
      different. Even though it is not one of the higher-paying professions, serving in the Australian defence
      force has many benefits for servicemen/women and their families. </p>
    <p>Trill determined that by examining the data available to her from Burning Glass, it is apparent that Security
      Analyst, or Security Consultant was listed low in the Occupations and not at all in demand amongst the
      Job Titles. This is an interesting discovery for Trill who was expecting demand for cybersecurity skills to be
      much higher. This has not changed Trill’s opinion regarding her job preference, because the skills used in
      that occupation are applicable for other, highly in-demand jobs.
