    <li>What does it do?</li>
    <li>What is the likely impact?</li>
    <li>How will this affect you?</li>

    <p>In the city of Milan in Italy, there is a museum dedicated to exhibiting
       the works of Leonardo Da Vinci. The exhibit includes a model of a 
       device known as the Self-propelling Cart, an invention designed as a 
       spring-driven wheeled device, purportedly to create theatrical stage 
       effects (Leonardo3 Museum n.d.). It may not be considered as either a 
       vehicle or autonomous by today’s standards, yet it is perhaps the earliest 
       example of an invention designed to move under its own power once released.
        Da Vinci was able to conceive an idea based on the technologies of his era,
         and now, modern engineers have access to materials and technologies that 
         allow them to explore the concept of devices that can not only propel 
         themselves, but also make their own decisions about how they will 
         navigate constantly changing environments. While the umbrella concept 
         of autonomous devices is quite broad, this discussion will focus 
         primarily on automotive technologies. It will highlight some of the 
         concepts and concerns, and will offer an overview of the present and 
         future of the state of the art of Autonomous Vehicles.</p>
    <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (2021) defines 6 levels 
      of vehicular autonomy, with the most rudimentary automation (level 1) 
      described as the provision of assistance technologies that respond to 
      the environment, yet where a human driver is required to manage nearly 
      all the operational tasks of a vehicle (SAE 2021). This level of technology 
      includes many already familiar driver aids, such as lane departure warning, 
      adaptive cruise control, steering assistance technologies, and automatic 
      emergency braking. Complete autonomy on the other hand (Level 5) would mean 
      the driver is removed from the equation entirely (SAE 2021) so that human 
      input is not required, and one might also argue perhaps that human 
      intervention might also not be desired. Such advanced autonomy requires 
      an amalgamation of technologies to achieve, such as GPS, cameras, radar, 
      wireless communication, and sensor technologies (Bagolee et. al. 2016), 
      which are all readily available today. However, to achieve absolute autonomy 
      these existing technologies would also need to be supplemented with new and 
      emerging technologies that may still be many years away. Concepts which 
      were once the stuff of science fiction are now considered to be realistic 
      and achievable. Thus, machine learning (Dia 2021), artificial intelligence,
       and self-driving software may enable autonomous vehicles to exhibit advanced 
       situational awareness. This would ensure that the self-driving vehicles of 
       the near future could be capable of surpassing the skills and instincts of 
       an experienced modern-day driver.</p>
    <p>The state of the art of autonomous vehicle technology presently operates 
      across several levels of driving automation. Vehicles that can be programmed 
      to drive and navigate yet cannot be trusted on their own without the vigilance
       of an experienced driver are considered partially automated 
       (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). Tesla (n.d.) and Cadillac (n.d.) currently offer 
       vehicles with partial driving automation. These vehicles are equipped with
        a combination of on-board cameras, ultrasonic-sensors, or LIDAR systems, 
        technologies which allow the vehicle to drive hands off the wheel in 
        environments compatible with the automation software. This seems likely 
        to mean highway driving where road conditions are reasonably predictable, 
        where basic driving functions can all be delegated to the vehicle s 
        computer under supervision yet are likely to require human intervention 
        when driving situations overwhelm the computer s capabilities. These 
        systems reduce the drivers task loading, by measuring the physical 
        environment around them, and responding to those measurements ccording to 
        predetermined algorithms, while the driver remains attentive to the wider 
        driving environment and applies real-time decision making.</p>
    <p>At automation level 3, the emphasis is now less on the sensory equipment
       and more on the software which analyses sensory input to detect the 
       changing environment and applies decision making to address those 
       changes (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). For comparison, a level 2 vehicle would 
       match the speed of a slow-moving vehicle in front of it, awaiting 
       instruction from the driver to change lanes, whereas the level 3 
       vehicle s computer could be trained to decide on its own whether it would 
       be appropriate to execute an overtaking manoeuvre. Level 3 is referred to 
       as Conditional Automation (SAE 2021), which indicates that the vehicle 
       still requires a competent and alert driver to monitor the driving situation 
       and take manual control where the vehicle is unable to adequately handle a 
       situation, or where a malfunction might occur. Therefore, by this definition
        level 3 automation is not fault-tolerant, nor is it situationally robust, 
        yet perhaps a necessary stepping-stone in creating a system that can 
        exhibit greater autonomy given time to train and test such systems.</p>
    <p>The technology becomes very interesting with vehicles at the 4th level of 
      automation. The key difference between Level 3 and Level 4 automation is 
      that Level 4 vehicles can intervene if things go wrong or there is a system 
      failure (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). This is essentially a quantum leap in terms 
      of the ability of the vehicle to drive itself. Not only does the system 
      need to be able to physically perform the tasks that drivers would employ 
      to operate a vehicle, it also needs the ability to apply decision-making 
      based both on the rules of driving, and to anticipate where others on the 
      road are not applying the same rules (Waymo 2021, p. 26). Automation 
      level 4 is thought of as High Driving Automation (SAE 2021), and while 
      existing driver aids such as automatic emergency braking will also help 
      to mitigate the circumstances of an accident, they are passive systems 
      that are triggered by sensors. Such passive systems can be triggered to 
      cause a vehicle to react suddenly regardless of the driving situation 
      because they are not situationally aware, whereas a high driving automation
       vehicle can evaluate the wider driving situation. If the vehicle is 
       being driven manually, and it determines that an accident may be imminent,
        it can decide on its own to apply measures to affect the outcome of that 
        accident, yet it can also analyse the situation and abort if it determines
         that an intervention is not warranted.</p>
    <p>There are currently only a few technology companies that are working actively
       on level 4 automation. Waymo is possibly the most notable of these, having 
       refined their technology since 2009, and purporting to be the first company 
       to complete a fully autonomous trip on public roads (Waymo 2021, p. 10). While 
       each company will have its own motivations for investing in autonomous vehicle 
       technologies, safety, mobility, and convenience (Aptiv Services US 2019,
        p. 2; Argo AI n.d.; Waymo 2021, p. 3) appear to be the common themes and 
        values advertised. The question, therefore, is whether autonomous vehicles
         will deliver on the promise to save lives and result in fewer injuries 
         or accidents. Hancock (2018) argues that it is difficult to acquire 
         meaningful statistics to compare when seemingly inconsequential events 
         are likely to be frequently under-reported, such as the near misses or 
         light scrapes that might occur daily for the average driver. Even so, it 
         appears that government bodies around the world are viewing vehicle 
         autonomy through a much broader economic lens.</p> 
    <p>Road safety affects the economy, and therefore substantial savings might 
      be made if road accidents can be reduced (Parliamentary Library & Information 
      Service 2017). Other non-safety benefits are also important considerations, 
      such as productivity increase for travellers not tasked with operating a 
      vehicle, reduced traffic congestion allowing roads to be used with increased
       speed and lane capacity, a reduced requirement for extensive parking in 
       urban centres, and a reduced need for individuals to own their own vehicles 
       (Parliamentary Library & Information Service 2017). With the rise of
        autonomous vehicles, however, another question to ask is with regards to 
        the likely impact on the economy when thousands of transportation workers 
        are unable to compete with driverless vehicles. A machine does not get tired, 
        does not function when impaired, and does not require payment or leave.
         Presumably, this means that road transportation costs are likely to be 
         reduced when there is a significant shift towards autonomous vehicles, 
         and it follows that the employment landscape will also change greatly in 
         the future, as there would be a reduced or removed requirement for 
         employment as a driver. Does this mean more people will have a greater 
         pool of disposable income to inject into the economy, or is it more 
         likely that there might be a rise in the rate of unemployment as a 
         result?</p> 
    <p>Other issues to consider are in terms of the social and societal impact 
      should the world find itself relying primarily on autonomous vehicles for 
      transportation. Will drivers be perceived to be placing the lives of others 
      in danger? Is it possible that protest groups might form due to the perception 
      that the rise in autonomy might be an attack on their rights or freedoms to
       own or drive a non-autonomous vehicle? Will intercity travel by air be 
       reduced if people can work or sleep in their vehicles, and will road and 
       traffic noise increase and extend into the later hours of the evening? 
       Could autonomous vehicles be hijacked for use in criminal activity, or 
       used as a weapon against a population?</p> 
    <p>At the personal social level, autonomous vehicles could mean that a 
      parent no longer needs to make time to transport a child to and from 
      school. Family road trips could see all family members spending more 
      time together on common activities during the trip, rather than having 
      a designated driver focused elsewhere. A Saturday night out on the town
       might not end in tragedy for families when individuals are too incapacitated
        to know that they should not be driving. Road rage incidents might become a 
        thing of the past, and perhaps this means arriving at work or home in a much
         calmer frame of mind. The recent COVID-19 pandemic also highlights the 
         risk of exposure to disease when travelling via crowded services, and 
         perhaps driverless vehicles might offer a pathway to minimise the risk and 
         spread of disease by providing a means for people to travel in greater 
         isolation.</p> 
    <p>As the technology advances and vehicle autonomy becomes more widely adopted,
       there are many questions that remain unanswered in terms of the impact of 
       the autonomous vehicle on society. While there certainly seem to be potential
        benefits to moving towards vehicular automation, it is unclear whether those 
        benefits will outweigh the problems that an emerging technology can 
        potentially introduce. However, speculation beforehand can only address the 
        ‘what if’ questions that arise and cannot address ‘what is’ questions of a 
        future with autonomous vehicles. Perhaps this requires a leap of faith to 
        trust that the technology might truly deliver on its promise to save lives 
        and reduce injuries, and therefore we should encourage autonomous vehicle 
        engineers to continue to move cautiously ahead now, and to learn from any 
        mistakes that are made along the way.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content-blockchain">
      <div class="content-inner-blockchain">

   
  <p>Blockchain is a decentralised ecosystem made up of encrypted units of data called blocks, which are linked to the previously created blocks to form a chain of information (Conway, 2021). The primary features of blockchain technology are that these blocks are immutable, decentralized, secure and provide a distributed transactional ledger which is quickly validated by consensus, allowing for a wide range of potential use cases (Iredale, 2020). Bitcoin has recently been receiving a much of the media’s attention about blockchain technology -- both good and bad -- due to its value as a currency, and the benefits it provides compared to fiat currencies. The use of blockchain-based smart contracts is paving a way to potentially change how we operate as a society.</p> 
  <p>Conway (2021) shows that even though the technology was first outlined in 1991, blockchain was first developed into a real-world application in 2009. Due to it being a relatively new technology, new use cases are being constantly identified as more people become familiar with it. Sedgwick (2019) indicated that the technology can currently be broken down into the following 5 use cases:</p> 
  <p><b>Currency:</b><br>The use of Blockchain as a currency has already become accepted, with Tesla accepting Bitcoins as payment for its vehicles within United States (Shead 2021). Other companies such as Visa and PayPal also have options to use cryptocurrency as a payment method. El Salvador’s president announced they will be adopting Bitcoin as legal tender (Dans 2021).</p> 
  <p><b>Smart Contracts:</b><br>Sedgwick (2019) explains that a smart contract is simply a blockchain base code that – once certain conditions are met – will trigger a predetermined outcome. This ability can be used for more than just a programmed release of money. CFI (n.d) elaborates that the technique can be used to share data between individuals securely and quickly, having the ability to encode health records with a private key, helping DRs and pharmacists access patient information fast and securely.</p> 
  <p><b>DeFi:</b><br>Decentralised finance can be used as an alternate to the traditional financial system with a decentralised exchange open for everybody no matter where they live (Eyre, n.d.).</p> 
  <p><b>Governance:</b><br>Majority rules in Blockchain, allowing for votes to be cast by all holders. The power required to mine bitcoin has been receiving a lot of media attention recently, yet a simple vote could be held to change it from a proof of work to a proof of stake and potentially cutting the power consumption drastically as indicated by Tezos (n.d.).</p> 
  <p><b>NFTs:</b><br>The proof of digital ownership has recently been used to justify burning an original piece of artwork. The owner of a Banksy artwork burned their piece of physical art causing the NFT to increase in value and become the real piece of art (Ennis 2021).</p> 
  <p>The future of Blockchain technology is exciting yet also potentially scary in the years ahead, as is with any new technology that we think is impossible today yet maybe possible tomorrow. The adoption of cryptocurrency as a legitimate payment system globally becomes more feasible with every passing day, allowing for no extra fees when purchasing items overseas while on a holiday. With the use of NFTs we are changing the way we look at digital ownership, copyright and how royalties are paid to the content creator. When purchasing a property, you may be presented with an NFT of the property and could be able to track the historical sales of it (Waterworth 2021), potentially creating an almost time capsule like form of digital data. This technology is also making a drastic change for artists that are struggling even though their art is selling for a ridiculous sum. Gilbert (2021) predicts that with the use of NFTs artists might be able to receive royalties each time an NFT is sold, providing an additional source of income.</p> 
  <p>However, a future for in which blockchain can thrive is still uncertain in today’s society, due to media attention on the value of Bitcoin fluctuating over such a short amount of time. In order for the adoption of cryptocurrency to be used as a global currency it will require governments to accept the technology as the United Kingdom is currently exploring (Browne, 2021). Power consumption is the latest issue to arise yet has already received a solution in El Salvador as Richer (2021) explains, where they have announced plans for using geothermal energy to mine bitcoin, helping to make bitcoin green by reducing the climate impact.</p> 
  <p>Blockchain technology may have the potential to profoundly change the world in everyday life, causing minor impact for some users while having a drastic effect on others. The potential crypto currency adoption could bring may go unnoticed noticed by the everyday EFTPOS user, since the payment method would remain the same. Although, behind the scenes changes within the banks may noticeably affect the Balinese shop owner incurring minimal fees while receiving payments almost instantly into their account from tourists on holiday from all over the world. As a result of this some jobs in the banking and fossil fuel industries may become redundant, yet with the new infrastructure required to implement a global currency, new jobs could be created for the construction and maintenance of the infrastructure. Consequently, with the ongoing use of the technology, new ideas and use cases will arise creating a demand for developers and teams to make them a reality, requiring a level of education that could lead to more teaching opportunities. As a result, the effect on jobs could stay much the same. However, Mckeecer (2020) states that blockchain is the number 1 in demand for hard skills globally, and as ConsenSys (2019) shows the phenomenal growth in listings in 2018 leads to a belief that if trends continue it could result in creating more jobs than redundancies, a greener more sustainable world, and an unforeseen number of positive effects.</p> 
  <p>Depending on the approach taken for the implementation of cryptocurrency, the adoption of block chain, and the extent of its implementation, the affects will vary from person to person as theorized above. A parent of multiple children or a care giver for multiple people may notice a decrease in the time it takes for health care services and insurance companies to access health records or issue prescriptions, allowing for a faster visit to these service providers with an unwell person or child. Collectors having trouble with available space may prefer to display a compact digital version of a bulky physical item, allowing for more space to display their most prized physical possessions. Along with the purchase of collector’s items such as a car, the owner may be able to own a digital version of the same vehicle that can be used in their favorited video game, or show supporting for their favourite teams by owning an NFT of their winning goal.</p> 
  <p>A standard working-class citizen may not notice a substantial change while being paid using online or EFTPOS payments as the changes will be handled automatically behind the scenes for most. Yet the businessperson traveling to different countries could notice a change in the ease of the payment process and time taken for account balances to appear due to the speed of blockchain technology. The security conscious may marvel at the ability to store one’s personal or business information in a highly secure and encrypted manner with restricted access, yet easily accessible any place, and any time (Callahan, 2017), making starting that new job and transferring personal information easier and less painstaking, which in turn may help productivity increase. However, blockchain has the potential to change the world in unexpected ways, unrealised in the eyes of people today, and similar to how the use of computers has brought phenomenal change. Blockchain’s true use case may be yet to be discovered or realised, and only with time, acceptance, and with worldwide adoption of the technology will we be able to tell.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-content-cloud">
    <div class="content-inner-cloud">
 
  <p>Cloud services are the backbone of today’s internet. Whether it is the top favourite search engine, top social media app, or the back-up of photos from a mobile phone, everything is increasingly relying on the ‘Cloud’. Since the inception of the internet, the involved technologies have grown rapidly (Coffman & Odlyzko 2011). Beginning during the Cold War as a last resort communications network, in the case of a nuclear war, the forerunning networks that predate the Internet began in the 1960s (Board of Regents n.d.). It was not until early 1983 that generally accepted internet protocols were used, with 1995 bringing into debut the World Wide Web and the Internet as we know it today. More recently, the cloud is one of the latest additions to this ongoing timeline, changing the way that people and devices interact across the world.</p> 
  <p>While there is some difficulty coming to a consensus on the definition of the ‘Cloud’, one approach describes it as embodying three concepts: Virtualisation, Elasticity and Utility (Leymann 2009). That is:<br>
  <ul id="text-list">
    <li>Cloud systems are services which are virtualised, whereby a user’s interactions are limited to the services provided and not the physical hardware;</li>
    <li>Elasticity means resource allocation scales to meet the needs of the user; and,</li>
    <li>Users pay for access to services received, not for specific items such as hardware maintenance, as would be done traditionally (Leymann 2009).</li>
  </ul></p> 
  <p>On a basic level, the premise of the ‘Cloud’ is in the move from traditional local servers - including dedicated server rooms, engineers and support staff - to the reliance on big data centres; dedicated warehouses purpose-built to store and maintain thousands of computer applications without any physical access required by the developer or end-user. Seamlessly usable, fast, and reliable, the cloud has brought the Internet from its own stone age like state to a bronze age, with present changes looking to be the beginning of an industrial ‘cloud’ revolution in the coming decades (Goodison 2020).</p> 
  <p>This method of providing services is a revolution that has seen business technologies become integrated within the cloud, with all the infrastructure needs of a business being provided as a service (IaaS), as opposed to the traditional model where businesses are required to maintain their own computing infrastructure on premises. Instead of each business requiring specialised employees or outsourcing a myriad of professional services, they can at the click of a button - without hiring specialist consultants - begin utilising services. This brings ease of access to a variety of online services to businesses, such as the following:</p> 
  <p><b>Instant website hosting & Virtual Servers</b><br>People with basic technological skills can easily create their own websites, without needing to know the complexities of setting up their own hardware (Spencer 2021). Running a small online project that requires ‘always online’ access is also now possible, through the leasing of virtual servers. Costs are kept low through load sharing, with multiple virtual servers running on one physical server that the user does not need to maintain (Net Standard 2020).</p> 
  <p><b>Utilise a Cluster of Servers</b><br>Server clusters can be used for large applications, running a program across multiple physical servers to spread load and reduce redundancy (VMware, Inc. 2019). This allows applications to serve millions of users or do analysis of terabytes of data. As an example, Facebook entertains 2.8 billion monthly users, creating a need for its own large server clusters (Statista 2021).</p> 
  <p><b>Deep Learning networks</b><br>Big Data analysis is an increasing need, with companies analysing historical data, future trends or attempting to find cures for diseases with genomic sampling. Large ‘farms’ of graphics card processors - efficient at processing information - are available on demand (Tibken 2020).</p> 
  <p><b>Data Storage and Backup</b><br>Businesses and individuals are accruing lots of data for which there is a need for storage. Cloud services for data are needed in several industries, with genomic sampling estimated to require 25 exabytes of storage by 2025 (The Medical Futurist 2018).</p>
  <p>These services are changing over time, and some experts are suggesting that the current state of technology is likely representative of the medium term, with one change visible on the horizon (Heath 2021). This change is the emergence of edge computing, the advent of which would add another layer to the current internet landscape and device interactions with the cloud. Predictions by Gartner are that by 2025, 75% of internet data will be processed outside of traditional data centers, occurring between local internet enabled devices and servers within their proximity (IBM 2018). As an upcoming trend this poses challenges, challenges shared by current services.</p>
  <p>One challenge is in infrastructure hurdles, such as the requirements for fast networks and well distributed server locations. Currently network traffic requirements are met using centralised servers, where frequently accessed content is cached in various locations to enable quick delivery (Ellingwood 2014). These challenges are likely to be ever present as the volume and type of data traffic increases to meet the rising requirements for new services and cloud connected devices. Additional infrastructure and advances in technology are required to mitigate the bottlenecks in our current networks.</p>
  <p>The effect of technology is something the modern individual cannot ignore. With the increasing rate of technological adoption, it is foreseeable that every human being will someday be able to access the cloud. Now, however, there are currently just under 60% of individuals world-wide connected to the internet. This means that billions of new people and devices will someday be connected to the cloud, creating additional demand for innovative technology. The pace of our lives will increase as many of the trivial daily tasks become more automated. Smart devices will increasingly do more, such as simple math, offer directions, and tell us when we need to seek medical treatment without needing to be asked.</p>
  <p>The privacy we know and appreciate - albeit in its limited capacity - today, may be above and beyond what we will have in the future. In a world so interconnected, our digital fingerprints are becoming much easier to trace (Chamorro-Premuzic & Nahai 2017; Kessler 2018). When all our actions are done through the cloud, our whole lives could come to depend on it, meaning we would also be susceptible when things go wrong, such as through cyber security incidents, as well as with changes in the jobs landscape brought about by the increasing adoption of these technologies.</p>
  <p>Cyber security incidents will likely increase. In Australia last year there was a cybercrime reported every 10 minutes (Skatssoon 2020). In recent months alone there have been several high-profile ransomware attacks announced (Blackfog 2021). Hackings, data leaks and fraud have become increasingly commonplace. These incidents affect everyone, from the unaware grandmas to the veteran security specialist. The constantly changing landscape requires continual vigilance on the part of every user.</p>
  <p>As the world becomes more connected by the cloud with potentially all our interactions going through it, everyone worldwide will be affected by both improvements in technology and the flow-on effects of any disruptions. One of these is the automation that the cloud allows, affecting the requirement for staff to perform the same duties. There are likely to be many new jobs in cloud services created and many in traditional IT lost, such as the change in nature of the roles created to manage in-house technology which have evolved into higher-level coordination between the different cloud services that businesses now require online (Stame 2020; Collabera n.d.).</p>
  <p>From work to family to gaming with friends, everything is becoming connected. Everyone in this generation grew up hearing their parents say: ‘In our day…’ regarding the state of modern conveniences. “We listened to the radio”, “we only had black and white,'' and “we used candles”. When it comes to this generation's turn, their statements will likely be far different. “We measured in megabytes” said to the child complaining they have used their 1 Petabyte storage. Such sentiments reflect the advances of technology in general, and the coming generations will reap the benefits of today’s innovations while their children bemoan the future state of the art while looking forward to even greater advancements.</p>
  <p>Although originally intended as a network designed for emergency government and military communication, the Internet has grown into a multifaceted “Cloud” network serving billions of people worldwide. The public reliance on the services of the cloud have evolved over time, yet many technologies have remained as consistent staples for the masses, such as the need for social media platforms for example. While it is difficult to see too far into the technological future, it seems likely that the current internet landscape will continue, with gradual improvements building on the legacy of current systems ensuring that the Cloud and its services are here to stay.</p>
