    <h2> Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
      <span class= "underline"</span>
    <p>In the city of Milan in Italy, there is a museum dedicated to exhibiting
       the works of Leonardo Da Vinci. The exhibit includes a model of a 
       device known as the Self-propelling Cart, an invention designed as a 
       spring-driven wheeled device, purportedly to create theatrical stage 
       effects (Leonardo3 Museum n.d.). It may not be considered as either a 
       vehicle or autonomous by todayâ€™s standards, yet it is perhaps the earliest 
       example of an invention designed to move under its own power once released.
        Da Vinci was able to conceive an idea based on the technologies of his era,
         and now, modern engineers have access to materials and technologies that 
         allow them to explore the concept of devices that can not only propel 
         themselves, but also make their own decisions about how they will 
         navigate constantly changing environments. While the umbrella concept 
         of autonomous devices is quite broad, this discussion will focus 
         primarily on automotive technologies. It will highlight some of the 
         concepts and concerns, and will offer an overview of the present and 
         future of the state of the art of Autonomous Vehicles.</p>
    <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (2021) defines 6 levels 
      of vehicular autonomy, with the most rudimentary automation (level 1) 
      described as the provision of assistance technologies that respond to 
      the environment, yet where a human driver is required to manage nearly 
      all the operational tasks of a vehicle (SAE 2021). This level of technology 
      includes many already familiar driver aids, such as lane departure warning, 
      adaptive cruise control, steering assistance technologies, and automatic 
      emergency braking. Complete autonomy on the other hand (Level 5) would mean 
      the driver is removed from the equation entirely (SAE 2021) so that human 
      input is not required, and one might also argue perhaps that human 
      intervention might also not be desired. Such advanced autonomy requires 
      an amalgamation of technologies to achieve, such as GPS, cameras, radar, 
      wireless communication, and sensor technologies (Bagolee et. al. 2016), 
      which are all readily available today. However, to achieve absolute autonomy 
      these existing technologies would also need to be supplemented with new and 
      emerging technologies that may still be many years away. Concepts which 
      were once the stuff of science fiction are now considered to be realistic 
      and achievable. Thus, machine learning (Dia 2021), artificial intelligence,
       and self-driving software may enable autonomous vehicles to exhibit advanced 
       situational awareness. This would ensure that the self-driving vehicles of 
       the near future could be capable of surpassing the skills and instincts of 
       an experienced modern-day driver.</p>
    <p>The state of the art of autonomous vehicle technology presently operates 
      across several levels of driving automation. Vehicles that can be programmed 
      to drive and navigate yet cannot be trusted on their own without the vigilance
       of an experienced driver are considered partially automated 
       (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). Tesla (n.d.) and Cadillac (n.d.) currently offer 
       vehicles with partial driving automation. These vehicles are equipped with
        a combination of on-board cameras, ultrasonic-sensors, or LIDAR systems, 
        technologies which allow the vehicle to drive hands off the wheel in 
        environments compatible with the automation software. This seems likely 
        to mean highway driving where road conditions are reasonably predictable, 
        where basic driving functions can all be delegated to the vehicle s 
        computer under supervision yet are likely to require human intervention 
        when driving situations overwhelm the computer s capabilities. These 
        systems reduce the drivers task loading, by measuring the physical 
        environment around them, and responding to those measurements ccording to 
        predetermined algorithms, while the driver remains attentive to the wider 
        driving environment and applies real-time decision making.</p>
    <p>At automation level 3, the emphasis is now less on the sensory equipment
       and more on the software which analyses sensory input to detect the 
       changing environment and applies decision making to address those 
       changes (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). For comparison, a level 2 vehicle would 
       match the speed of a slow-moving vehicle in front of it, awaiting 
       instruction from the driver to change lanes, whereas the level 3 
       vehicle s computer could be trained to decide on its own whether it would 
       be appropriate to execute an overtaking manoeuvre. Level 3 is referred to 
       as Conditional Automation (SAE 2021), which indicates that the vehicle 
       still requires a competent and alert driver to monitor the driving situation 
       and take manual control where the vehicle is unable to adequately handle a 
       situation, or where a malfunction might occur. Therefore, by this definition
        level 3 automation is not fault-tolerant, nor is it situationally robust, 
        yet perhaps a necessary stepping-stone in creating a system that can 
        exhibit greater autonomy given time to train and test such systems.</p>
    <p>The technology becomes very interesting with vehicles at the 4th level of 
      automation. The key difference between Level 3 and Level 4 automation is 
      that Level 4 vehicles can intervene if things go wrong or there is a system 
      failure (Synopsis Inc. n.d.). This is essentially a quantum leap in terms 
      of the ability of the vehicle to drive itself. Not only does the system 
      need to be able to physically perform the tasks that drivers would employ 
      to operate a vehicle, it also needs the ability to apply decision-making 
      based both on the rules of driving, and to anticipate where others on the 
      road are not applying the same rules (Waymo 2021, p. 26). Automation 
      level 4 is thought of as High Driving Automation (SAE 2021), and while 
      existing driver aids such as automatic emergency braking will also help 
      to mitigate the circumstances of an accident, they are passive systems 
      that are triggered by sensors. Such passive systems can be triggered to 
      cause a vehicle to react suddenly regardless of the driving situation 
      because they are not situationally aware, whereas a high driving automation
       vehicle can evaluate the wider driving situation. If the vehicle is 
       being driven manually, and it determines that an accident may be imminent,
        it can decide on its own to apply measures to affect the outcome of that 
        accident, yet it can also analyse the situation and abort if it determines
         that an intervention is not warranted.</p>
    <p>There are currently only a few technology companies that are working actively on level 4 automation. Waymo is possibly the most notable of these, having refined their technology since 2009, and purporting to be the first company to complete a fully autonomous trip on public roads (Waymo 2021, p. 10). While each company will have its own motivations for investing in autonomous vehicle technologies, safety, mobility, and convenience (Aptiv Services US 2019, p. 2; Argo AI n.d.; Waymo 2021, p. 3) appear to be the common themes and values advertised. The question, therefore, is whether autonomous vehicles will deliver on the promise to save lives and result in fewer injuries or accidents. Hancock (2018) argues that it is difficult to acquire meaningful statistics to compare when seemingly inconsequential events are likely to be frequently under-reported, such as the near misses or light scrapes that might occur daily for the average driver. Even so, it appears that government bodies around the world are viewing vehicle autonomy through a much broader economic lens.</p> 
    <p>Road safety affects the economy, and therefore substantial savings might be made if road accidents can be reduced (Parliamentary Library & Information Service 2017). Other non-safety benefits are also important considerations, such as productivity increase for travellers not tasked with operating a vehicle, reduced traffic congestion allowing roads to be used with increased speed and lane capacity, a reduced requirement for extensive parking in urban centres, and a reduced need for individuals to own their own vehicles (Parliamentary Library & Information Service 2017). With the rise of autonomous vehicles, however, another question to ask is with regards to the likely impact on the economy when thousands of transportation workers are unable to compete with driverless vehicles. A machine does not get tired, does not function when impaired, and does not require payment or leave. Presumably, this means that road transportation costs are likely to be reduced when there is a significant shift towards autonomous vehicles, and it follows that the employment landscape will also change greatly in the future, as there would be a reduced or removed requirement for employment as a driver. Does this mean more people will have a greater pool of disposable income to inject into the economy, or is it more likely that there might be a rise in the rate of unemployment as a result?</p> 
    <p>Other issues to consider are in terms of the social and societal impact should the world find itself relying primarily on autonomous vehicles for transportation. Will drivers be perceived to be placing the lives of others in danger? Is it possible that protest groups might form due to the perception that the rise in autonomy might be an attack on their rights or freedoms to own or drive a non-autonomous vehicle? Will intercity travel by air be reduced if people can work or sleep in their vehicles, and will road and traffic noise increase and extend into the later hours of the evening? Could autonomous vehicles be hijacked for use in criminal activity, or used as a weapon against a population?</p> 
    <p>At the personal social level, autonomous vehicles could mean that a parent no longer needs to make time to transport a child to and from school. Family road trips could see all family members spending more time together on common activities during the trip, rather than having a designated driver focused elsewhere. A Saturday night out on the town might not end in tragedy for families when individuals are too incapacitated to know that they should not be driving. Road rage incidents might become a thing of the past, and perhaps this means arriving at work or home in a much calmer frame of mind. The recent COVID-19 pandemic also highlights the risk of exposure to disease when travelling via crowded services, and perhaps driverless vehicles might offer a pathway to minimise the risk and spread of disease by providing a means for people to travel in greater isolation.</p> 
    <p>As the technology advances and vehicle autonomy becomes more widely adopted, there are many questions that remain unanswered in terms of the impact of the autonomous vehicle on society. While there certainly seem to be potential benefits to moving towards vehicular automation, it is unclear whether those benefits will outweigh the problems that an emerging technology can potentially introduce. However, speculation beforehand can only address the â€˜what ifâ€™ questions that arise and cannot address â€˜what isâ€™ questions of a future with autonomous vehicles. Perhaps this requires a leap of faith to trust that the technology might truly deliver on its promise to save lives and reduce injuries, and therefore we should encourage autonomous vehicle engineers to continue to move cautiously ahead now, and to learn from any mistakes that are made along the way.</p>
